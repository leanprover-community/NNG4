# Welcome to the Natural Number Game
#### An introduction to mathematical proof.

In this game, we will build the basic theory of the natural
numbers `{0,1,2,3,4,...}` from scratch. Our first goal is to prove
that `2 + 2 = 4`. Next we'll prove that `x + y = y + x`.
And at the end we'll see if we can prove Fermat's Last Theorem.
We'll do this by solving levels of a computer puzzle game
in a programming language called Lean.

# Read this.

Learning how to use an interactive theorem prover takes time.
Tests show that the people who get the most out of this game are
those who read the help texts like this one.

To start, click on \"Tutorial World\".

Note: this is a new Lean 4 version of the game containing several
worlds which were not present in the old Lean 3 version. More new worlds
such as Strong Induction World, Even/Odd World and Prime Number World
are in development; if you want to see their state or even help out, checkout
out the [issues in the github repo](https://github.com/leanprover-community/NNG4/issues).

Please ask any questions about this game in the
[Lean Zulip chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) forum, for example in
the stream \"New Members\". The community will happily help. Note that
the Lean Zulip chat is a professional research forum.
Please use your full real name there, stay on topic, and be nice. If you're
looking for somewhere less formal (e.g. you want to post natural number
game memes) then head on over to the [Lean Discord](https://discord.gg/WZ9bs9UCvx).

Alternatively, if you experience issues / bugs you can also open github issues:

* For issues with the game engine, please open an
[issue at the lean4game](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game/issues) repo.
* For issues about the game's content, please open an
[issue at the NNG](https://github.com/hhu-adam/NNG4/issues) repo.
