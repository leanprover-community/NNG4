Introduction
" Let's see if you can use the tactics we've learnt to prove $x+1=y+1\\implies x=y$.

Statement (x y : ℕ) : x + 1 = y + 1 → x = y := by
  Hint (hidden := true) "Start with `intro h` to assume the hypothesis."
  intro h
  Hint (hidden := true) "Now `repeat rw [← succ_eq_add_one] at h` is the quickest way to
  change `h` to `succ x = succ y`."
  repeat rw [← succ_eq_add_one] at h
  Hint (hidden := true) "Now `apply succ_inj at h` to cancel the `succ`s."
  apply succ_inj at h
  Hint (hidden := true) "Now `rw [h]` then `rfl` works, but `exact h` is quicker."
  exact h

Conclusion "Here's a completely backwards proof:
```
intro h
apply succ_inj
repeat rw [succ_eq_add_one]
exact h
```
