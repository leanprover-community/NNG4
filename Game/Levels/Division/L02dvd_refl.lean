  In this level, we will prove that n ∣ n for any natural number n.
  In other words, 'divides' is a reflexive relation on the natural
  numbers. Hint try `use 1`.

Statement dvd_refl
    (n : ℕ) :  n ∣ n := by
      use 1
      rw[mul_one]
      rfl

Conclusion
"
  Well Done, you have now proven that division is a reflexive relation, the next step is to prove that n|0.
