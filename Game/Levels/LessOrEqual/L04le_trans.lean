`le_trans x y z` is a proof that if `x ≤ y` and `y ≤ z` then `x ≤ z`.
More precisely, it is a proof that `x ≤ y → (y ≤ z → x ≤ z)`. In words,
If $x \\le y$ then (pause) if $y \\le z$ then $x \\le z$.

## A note on associativity

In Lean, `a + b + c` means `(a + b) + c`, because `+` is left associative. However
`→` is right associative. This means that `x ≤ y → y ≤ z → x ≤ z` in Lean means
exactly that `≤` is transitive. This is different to how mathematicians use
$P\\implies Q\\implies R$; for them, this usually means that $P\\implies Q$
and $Q\\implies R$.

Introduction "
In this level, we see inequalities as *hypotheses*. We have not seen this before.
The `cases` tactic can be used to take `hxy` apart.

Statement le_trans (x y z : ℕ) (hxy : x ≤ y) (hyz : y ≤ z) : x ≤ z := by
  Hint "Start with `cases hxy with a ha`."
  cases hxy with a ha
  Hint "Now `ha` is a proof that `y = x + a`, and `hxy` has vanished. Similarly, you can destruct
  `hyz` into its parts with `cases hyz with b hb`."
  cases hyz with b hb
  Hint "Now you need to figure out which number to `use`. See if you can take it from here."
  use a + b
  rw [hb, ha]
  exact add_assoc x a b

Conclusion "
A passing mathematician remarks that with reflexivity and transitivity out of the way,
you have proved that `≤` is a *preorder* on `ℕ`.
