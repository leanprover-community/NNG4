# Summary
The `left` tactic changes a goal of `P ∨ Q` into a goal of `P`.
Use it when your hypotheses guarantee that the reason that `P ∨ Q`
is true is because in fact `P` is true.

Internally this tactic is just `apply`ing a theorem
saying that $P \implies P \lor Q.$

Note that this tactic can turn a solvable goal into an unsolvable
one.

Introduction "
Totality of `≤` is the boss level of this world, and it's coming up next. It says that
if `a` and `b` are naturals then either `a ≤ b` or `b ≤ a`.
But we haven't talked about `or` at all. Here's a run-through.

1) The notation for \"or\" is `∨`. You won't need to type it, but you can
type it with `\\or`.

2) If you have an \"or\" statement in the *goal*, then two tactics make
progress: `left` and `right`. But don't choose a direction unless your
hypotheses guarantee that it's the correct one.

3) If you have an \"or\" statement as a *hypothesis* `h`, then
`cases h with h1 h2` will create two goals, one where you went left,
and the other where you went right.
