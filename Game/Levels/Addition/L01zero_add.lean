World "Addition"
Level 1
Title "zero_add"

namespace MyNat

Introduction
"
In this level we're going to prove that $0+n=n$, where $n$ is a secret natural number.

Wait, don't we already know that? No! We know that $n+0=n$, but that's `add_zero`.
This is `zero_add`, which is different.

The difficulty with proving `0 + n = n` is that we do not have a *formula* for
`0 + n` in general, we can only use `add_zero` and `add_succ` once
we know whether `n` is `0` or a successor. The `induction` tactic splits into these two cases.

The base case will require us to prove `0 + 0 = 0`, and the inductive step
will ask us to show that if `0 + d = d` then `0 + succ d = succ d`. Because
`0` and successor are the only way to make numbers, this will cover all the cases.

See if you can do your first induction proof in Lean.

(By the way, if you are still in the \"Editor mode\" from the last world, you can swap
back to \"Typewriter mode\" by clicking the `>_` button in the top right.)

`zero_add x` is the proof of `0 + x = x`.

`zero_add` is a `simp` lemma, because replacing `0 + x` by `x`
is almost always what you want to do if you're simplifying an expression.

## Summary

If `n : ℕ` is an object, and the goal mentions `n`, then `induction n with d hd`
attempts to prove the goal by induction on `n`, with the inductive
variable in the successor case being `d`, and the inductive hypothesis being `hd`.

### Example:
If the goal is
```
0 + n = n
```

then

`induction n with d hd`

will turn it into two goals. The first is `0 + 0 = 0`;
the second has an assumption `hd : 0 + d = d` and goal
`0 + succ d = succ d`.

Note that you must prove the first
goal before you can access the second one.

Conclusion
"
  This lemma would have been easy if we had known that `x + y = y + x`. That theorem
  is called `add_comm` and it is *true*, but unfortunately its proof *uses* both
  `add_zero` and `zero_add`!

  Let's continue on our journey to `add_comm`, the proof of `x + y = y + x`.
