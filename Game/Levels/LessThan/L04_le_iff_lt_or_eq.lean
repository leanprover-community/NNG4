Introduction "This level shows that `a ≤ b ↔ (a < b) ∨ (a = b)`.  In
spoken form (\"`a` is less than or equal to `b` iff `a` is less than or
equal to `b`\"); this is a tautology, so it is a worthwhile exercise to
check that our mathematical definitions also make linguistic sense."

/--If `a` and `b` are  natural numbers, then `a ≤ b` iff (`a < b` or `a = b`).

Conclusion "Nice job. In the `≤`-world you showed that for all natural
numbers `a`, we have `0 ≤ a`. In the next level, you will show that zero
is not greater than any natural number."
