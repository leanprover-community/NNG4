/-- `lt_iff_le_not_le a b` is a proof that  `a < b ↔ (a ≤ b) ∧ ¬(b ≤ a)`. -/

Introduction "There are many equivalent ways we could have defined the
`<` relation.  The one that we chose allows the proofs in this world
to be simpler, but isn't the default way that Lean would have defined
it.  In this level, we show that our definition is equivalent to
Lean's default definition of `<`."

/--If `a` and `b` are natural numbers, then `a < b` iff `a ≤ b` and `¬(b ≤ a)`. -/

Conclusion "The mathematician who passed by after the transitiviy
level of `≤` world, remarks that you have shown that the natural
numbers equipped with our choice for the definition of `<`, is a *preorder*,
a *Partial order* and a *Linear order*."
