There\nare two distinct situations where you can use this tactic.\n\n1) Basic usage: if `h : A = B` is an assumption or\nthe proof of a theorem, and if the goal contains one or more `A`s, then `rw [h]`\nwill change them all to `B`'s. The tactic will error\nif there are no `A`s in the goal.\n\n2) Advanced usage: Assumptions coming from theorem proofs\noften have missing pieces. For example `add_zero`\nis a proof that `? + 0 = ?` because `add_zero` really is a function,\nand `?` is the input. In this situation `rw` will look through the goal\nfor any subterm of the form `x + 0`, and the moment it\nfinds one it fixes `?` to be `x` then changes all `x + 0`s to `x`s.\n\nExercise: think about why `rw [add_zero]` changes the term\n`(0 + 0) + (x + 0) + (0 + 0) + (x + 0)` to\n`0 + (x + 0) + 0 + (x + 0)`\n\nIf you can't remember the name of the proof of an equality, look it up in\nthe list of lemmas on the right.\n\n## Targetted usage\n\nIf your goal is `b + c + a = b + (a + c)` and you want to rewrite `a + c`\nto `c + a`, then `rw [add_comm]` will not work because Lean finds another\naddition first and swaps those inputs instead. Use `rw [add_comm a c]` to\nguarantee that Lean rewrites `a + c` to `c + a`. This works because\n`add_comm` is a proof that `?1 + ?2 = ?2 + ?1`, `add_comm a` is a proof\nthat `a + ? = ? + a`, and `add_comm a c` is a proof that `a + c = c + a`.\n\nIf `h : X = Y` then `rw [h]` will turn all `X`s into `Y`s.\nIf you only want to change the 37th occurrence of `X`\nto `Y` then do `nth_rewrite 37 [h]`.":
